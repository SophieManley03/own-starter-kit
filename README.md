## Personal bootstrap

I decided to create my own bootstrap to simplify the next projects I will develop.

### Launch the project
`npm run watch`
The project should open itself on your browser (`localhost:3000`)

### What's in?
* Hot reload:
`webpack-dev-server` + `browser-sync`
* Prettier
* React
* Typescript
* redux
* typestyle

### What is missing?
* react-router
* jest
